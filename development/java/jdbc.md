## `PreparedStatement`

When not all bind variables are supplied then execution leads to `SQLException`.

When running a query on a `PreparedStatement`, it closes any already open `ResultSet` objects associated with the statement. Therefore, it throws a `SQLException` if we are trying to call `next()` on a closed `ResultSet`.

`boolean execute() throws SQLException` - `true` if the first result is a `ResultSet` object; `false` if the first result is an update count or there is no result. You must call either the method `getResultSet` or `getUpdateCount` to retrieve the result.

`ResultSet executeQuery() throws SQLException` - executes the SQL query in this `PreparedStatement` object and returns the `ResultSet` object generated by the query.

`int executeUpdate() throws SQLException` - executes the SQL statement in this `PreparedStatement` object, which must be an SQL Data Manipulation Language \(DML\) statement, such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE; or an SQL statement that returns nothing, such as a DDL statement. For SELECT queries `SQLException` is thrown.

`void setString(int parameterIndex, String x) throws SQLException` - throws `SQLException` if `parameterIndex` does not correspond to a parameter marker in the SQL statement.

## `CallableStatement`

The interface used to execute SQL stored procedures.
