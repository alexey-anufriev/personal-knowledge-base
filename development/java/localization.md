# Localization

## Common

Locale as a geographical, political, or cultural region.

Java starts out by looking for a properties file with the requested locale. If it doesn't find it, then it moves onto the default locale.

`Locale` has `getDefault()` and `setDefault()` methods for working with the default locale.
